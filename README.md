After careful consideration, **the Medieval Theme** has been chosen.

### Setting Up the Name Generator

To make the Name Generator work, you'll need to:

1. **Download SQLite**:  
   Download and install SQLite from [sqlite.org](https://www.sqlite.org/).

2. **Install PHP SQLite Extension**:  
   Ensure that the PHP SQLite extension is installed and enabled on your server.

3. **Configure Database Path**:  
   In the `nameGenerator.php` file, set the path to your SQLite database like so:

   ```php
   <?php
   // Path to your SQLite database file
   $db_path = 'path_to_your_database.sqlite';

   // Connect to SQLite database
   $db = new SQLite3($db_path);
   ?>
**Sqlite is much more efficient compared to the bloat MySql***
